  <h3>Sweet 'n sour pork chops shine in this easy recipe featuring pineapple, onion, soy sauce, green onions, and Campbell's Condensed Golden Mushroom Soup</h3>

  <p>Joe loves pork chops; I can't stand them. Since Joe does most of our day to day cooking, I encourage him to make them sometimes. You know, 'cause he loves them. I manage. I almost sorta like pork chops when they're made using this recipe. As long as they're not cooked into hockey puck toughness. Which is most of the time. I just don't get it.</p>
  
  <p>Anyway, this is a nice recipe, and it would be great with chicken breasts or pulled pork. Joe thinks it's awesome with pork chops.</p>
