ODIN PROJECT - RECIPE WEBPAGE

    This is the first of many projects to be completed during my journey through The Odin Project.

    We will be using basic command line and HTML in order to develop a static webpage detailing a specific recipe.

    This project may be re-visited in the future to experiment with new languages or tools.
